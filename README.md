## Notes
This project was completed after I finished TheOdinProject's [Async JavaScript and API's sections](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript#asynchronous-javascript-and-apis). I decided to take this recently learned skill and applied it to a personal project.
